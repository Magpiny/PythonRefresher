Classes provide a means of bundling data and functionality together. Creating a new class creates a new type
of object, allowing new instances of that type to be made. Each class instance can have attributes attached 
to it for maintaining its state. Class instances can also have methods (defined by its class) for modifying 
its state.

A namespace is a mapping from names to objects. Most namespaces are currently implemented as Python dictionaries

The global statement can be used to indicate that particular variables live in the global scope and should be 
rebound there; the nonlocal statement indicates that particular variables live in an enclosing scope and should be rebound there

THE SELF PARAMETER
The self parameter is a reference to the current instance of the class, and is used to access variables that belongs to the class.

It does not have to be named self , you can call it whatever you like, but it has to be the first parameter of any function in the class:
